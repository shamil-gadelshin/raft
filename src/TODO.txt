Future Features:
- transfer leadership

- rsm
    .persistent
        .load on start
- operation-log
    .add failure reason to AppendEntryResponse
    .park-unpark the send_heartbeat_append_entries thread - remove unnecessary mutex-lock
    .support max AppendEntries number (replicate log in rounds)
- optimization
    .operation_log replication
        .empty (heartbeat) AppendEntries on node's current operation_log index evaluating(reduce 'no prev entry' rounds

        .park-unpark the worker thread
    .elections
        .abort election thread on election canceling (changing to Follower by peer requests)
- stability
    .on termination - shutdown communication workers first
        .remove channel.send().expect  (and recv also) - handle disconnection error (because of node termination)
    .migrate Mutex to parking_lot implementation
- debug

    .futures


Done:
- support single node
- investigate
    .election trait?
    .rebuild raft election fsm: implement explicit transitions causes (received AppendEntryRequest, HeartbeatWaitingTimeExpired, etc)
    .Replicate State Machine or Rsm?
    .investigate channels faults
    .'static in the 'Log : LogStorage + Sync + Send+ 'static'
    .Arc<dyn Log> to get rid of &static + Send ...
